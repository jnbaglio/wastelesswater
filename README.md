# wastelesswater
Web app calculator for the Wasteless water shark tank project
ðŸ’§ Hydro Power Output Calculator
A web-based calculator for estimating the power generation potential and financial savings of a small-scale hydroelectric system using greywater from residential buildings.

This tool is ideal for sustainability-focused engineers, educators, building managers, or anyone exploring alternative energy systems based on domestic wastewater flow.

ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ”¢ User Inputs:

Pipe diameter (in inches)

Number of families in the building (using average greywater output per family)

Number of greywater pipes used

Cost per kilowatt-hour (with tooltip info)

Installation cost for the system

âš¡ Calculations Provided:

Greywater flow rate per pipe (GPM)

Hydraulic power and stored electrical power (watts)

Monthly and annual energy output (kWh)

Estimated annual savings based on energy costs

5-year and 10-year cumulative savings

Estimated break-even period (in years)

ðŸ“Ž Built With:

React + Tailwind CSS

Shadcn/ui components for a clean, modern UI

ðŸ“Š Assumptions
Each family generates ~160 gallons of greywater per day

Power generation is limited to 2 hours/day

Generator efficiency: 65%

Inductive transmission efficiency: 50% (adjustable in future versions)

ðŸ§  Use Cases
Estimating the return on investment for greywater energy recovery systems

Teaching students about energy conversion and environmental engineering

Feasibility modeling for green infrastructure projects in buildings
